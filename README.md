## Capsid
A <b>capsid</b> is the protein shell of a virus. Virus particles contain the viral genome packaged in a <i>protein coat</i> called the <b>capsid</b>. For some viruses, the capsid is surrounded by lipid bilayer that contains viral proteins, usually including the proteins that enable the virus to bind to the host cells. This lipid and protein structure is called the virus envelope, and is derived from the host cell membranes. The capsid and envelope play many roles in viral infection, including virus attachment to cells, entry into cells, release of the capsid contents into the cells, and packaging of newly formed viral particles. The <i>capsid</i> and <i>envelope</i> are also responsible for transfer of the viral genetic material from one cell to another. These structures also determine the stability characteristics of the virus particle, such as resistance to chemical or physical inactivation.
