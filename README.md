## Capsid
A <b>capsid</b> is the protein shell of a virus. Virus particles contain the viral genome packaged in a <i>protein coat</i> called the <b>capsid</b>. For some viruses, the capsid is surrounded by lipid bilayer that contains viral proteins, usually including the proteins that enable the virus to bind to the host cells. This lipid and protein structure is called the virus envelope, and is derived from the host cell membranes. The capsid and envelope play many roles in viral infection, including virus attachment to cells, entry into cells, release of the capsid contents into the cells, and packaging of newly formed viral particles. The <i>capsid</i> and <i>envelope</i> are also responsible for transfer of the viral genetic material from one cell to another. These structures also determine the stability characteristics of the virus particle, such as resistance to chemical or physical inactivation.

### Structural Facts
A well known fact about <b>capsid</b> is, it encloses the genetic material of the virus and it consists of several oligomeric structural subunits made of protein called <b>protomers</b>. The observable 3-dimensional morphological subunits, which may or may not correspond to individual proteins, are called <b>capsomeres</b>.

The <b>capsomere</b> is a subunit of the capsid, an outer covering of protein that protects the genetic material of a virus. Capsomeres self-assemble to form the capsid. It's subunits called protomers aggregate to form capsomeres. Various arrangements of capsomeres are: (1) Icosahedral, (2) Helical, and (3) Complex.
